# ASCIIMage v1.0
An easy image into ASCII convertion software with features such as color and custom maps.  
No linux :(

## Dependencies
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) fast and easy image reading.
- [ponsole](https://github.com/POLA-LCS/ponsole) for printing color characters in the windows console.

## Get started
Just clone it anywhere and run the `make.bat` file.  
This should generate `asciimage.exe`, run it and start converting images!
